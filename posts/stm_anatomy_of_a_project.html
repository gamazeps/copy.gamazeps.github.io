<h1 id="main-files-of-a-chibiosrt-application">Main files of a ChibiOS/RT application</h1>
<p>When you created your first ChibiOS/RT project I had you copy an existing one and tweaking it a little. While it allowed you to have something working quickly we did not explain exactly what were the files in the project, let’s do that now.</p>
<p>A simple <code>ls project</code> will give you:</p>
<pre><code>➜  ls project 
build  chconf.h  halconf.h  main.c  Makefile  mcuconf.h  readme.txt</code></pre>
<p>Let’s go over each of these files.</p>
<h2 id="chconf.h">chconf.h</h2>
<p>This file allows you to configure the OS part of ChibiOS/RT.</p>
<p>Here you can enable (or disable) many features, such as threading, synchronization, checks and options about how your threads run.</p>
<p>The default values in this configuration file are usually correct, so you will probably never have to change it.</p>
<h2 id="halconf.h">halconf.h</h2>
<p>This file allows you to configure the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) of your project.</p>
<p>Here you can enable or disable device drivers, this is something that you will have to do quite often.</p>
<p>For example, defining <code>HAL_USE_I2C</code> to <code>TRUE</code> will allow you to use I2C related code, otherwise the code will not compile.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="co">/**</span>
<span class="co"> * </span><span class="an">@brief</span><span class="co">   Enables the I2C subsystem.</span>
<span class="co"> */</span>
<span class="pp">#if !defined(HAL_USE_I2C) || defined(__DOXYGEN__)</span>
<span class="pp">#define HAL_USE_I2C                 FALSE</span>
<span class="pp">#endif</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see that in the hello LED project that you have <code>HAL_USE_PAL</code> set to <code>TRUE</code>, indeed we used the PAL driver when we did:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">    palSetPadMode(GPIOD, <span class="dv">15</span>, PAL_MODE_OUTPUT_PUSHPULL);
    <span class="co">// ....</span>
        palSetPad(GPIOD, <span class="dv">15</span>); <span class="co">// sets GPIOD 15 high</span>
        palClearPad(GPIOD, <span class="dv">15</span>); <span class="co">// sets GPIOD 15 low</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="mcuconf.h">mcuconf.h</h2>
<p>This file allows you to configure the drivers of your project (we will talk later about what the drivers are).</p>
<p>Let’s see what this looks like for the PWM driver:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="co">/*</span>
<span class="co"> * PWM driver system settings.</span>
<span class="co"> */</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_USE_ADVANCED              FALSE</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_USE_TIM1                  FALSE</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_USE_TIM2                  FALSE</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_USE_TIM3                  FALSE</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_USE_TIM4                  FALSE</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_USE_TIM5                  FALSE</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_USE_TIM8                  FALSE</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_USE_TIM9                  FALSE</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_TIM1_IRQ_PRIORITY         7</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_TIM2_IRQ_PRIORITY         7</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_TIM3_IRQ_PRIORITY         7</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_TIM4_IRQ_PRIORITY         7</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_TIM5_IRQ_PRIORITY         7</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_TIM8_IRQ_PRIORITY         7</span>
<span class="pp">#define STM32_PWM_TIM9_IRQ_PRIORITY         7</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here you can activate the PWM drivers (there is one for each PWM), and their respective interruption priorities (we will talk about what that means later).</p>
<p>You can also configure the PLLs of your main clock, this means that you can change the frequency of your processor clock (we will also talk about that later).</p>
<h2 id="main.c">main.c</h2>
<p>You should know what this is :)</p>
<h2 id="makefile">Makefile</h2>
<p>The Makefile contains the build instructions of your code, I assume that you have some knowledge of what a Makefile is, but we will go deeper on how to use ChibiOS/RT’s one later.</p>
<h2 id="board.c-board.h-and-board.mk">board.c, board.h and board.mk</h2>
<p>These two files are not present in this demo project (so don’t panic if you can’t see them), as it uses the ones of the demo project inside ChibiOS/RT’s sources.</p>
<p>These two files allow you to separate the application code from the board configuration, and thus allowing you to have a more portable code that can be used on multiple boards.</p>
<h3 id="board.h">board.h</h3>
<p>This allows you to configure the pins on your board.</p>
<p>You can configure the mode of the pin, its pull-up or pull-down resistors, which alternate function to use and so on.</p>
<p>It is also good practice to:</p>
<ul>
<li>define macros for your pins there (such as <code>BLUE_LED</code> or <code>LEFT_MOTOR</code>).</li>
<li>configure your pins in this file instead of using <code>palSetPadMode</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="board.c">board.c</h3>
<p>You can write your board specific initialization code here.</p>
<h3 id="board.mk">board.mk</h3>
<p>Board specific Makefile, you usualy won’t need to have more than:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode makefile"><code class="sourceCode makefile"><span class="co"># List of all the board related files.</span>
<span class="dt">BOARDSRC </span><span class="ch">=</span><span class="st"> ../board/board.c</span>

<span class="co"># Required include directories</span>
<span class="dt">BOARDINC </span><span class="ch">=</span><span class="st"> ../board</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You could even get rid of it if your board does not need a Makefile and define these in the application’s Makfile.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-organize-your-project">How to organize your project</h1>
<p>It is considered a good practice to have a tree looking like:</p>
<pre><code>- ChibiOS/RT
- boards
  - board_1
    - board.c
    - board.h
    - board.mk
  - other_boards
- src
  - chconf.h
  - halconf.h
  - main.c
  - Makefile
  - mcuconf.h
  - other.c and .h files</code></pre>
<p>That’s about it, I hope that this gave you a better understanding on what are the files in a CHibiOS/RT’s project and where to put them.</p>
