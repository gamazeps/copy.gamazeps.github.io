<h1 id="blog-2">Blog 2</h1>
<p>Hi again !</p>
<p>Today was not a very fruitful day in terms of personal work.</p>
<p>I planned on:</p>
<ul>
<li>going to the gym</li>
<li>setting up my computer with pelican</li>
<li>do the maths for lecture 8 of deep learning</li>
<li>do the maths for lecture 2 of reinforcement learning</li>
<li>freshen up on statistics definitions</li>
<li>set up pelican on my new computer (in order to publish)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not much was done though…</p>
<p>I did manage to go to the gym, which is nice, but did not manage to do much coding after that.</p>
<p>I watched part of lecture 3 on reinforcement learning and freshen up in stats definitions.</p>
<p>Thus I failed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>do maths</li>
<li>finish lecture 3</li>
</ul>
<p>The process kinda worked until about 3pm, when unexpedness messed up my planning and I didn’t manage to fall back on my feets (planning wise).</p>
<p>Since tomorrow night is a night out (John Wick II), I don’t believe that my super training program in ML will be well followed, which kinda sucks. I can nevertheless leave the office late and do some maths before leaving.</p>
<p>Work wise I managed to have a good draft of the blog entry I will post in two weeks for tweag, and spent some time reading haskell blog posts from tweag and FP complete in order to familiarize myself with the expected writing style. I found it odd that most haskell related blog posts are extremely wordy and convoluted, which is far different from what I am generaly used to (much shorter and to the point).</p>
