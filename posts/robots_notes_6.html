<h1 id="futures">Futures</h1>
<p>Yay !</p>
<p>I finally made everything compile, which is nice, now let’s adapt the code to use the new futures.</p>
<p>I nevertheless found an issue with my implementation, this requires to know when we are addressing a future and we are not.</p>
<p>Thus my <code>forward_to</code> functions needs to be different when we forward to an actor and when we forward to a future (when we chain futures).</p>
<p>In my implementation I thought we needed to send specific messages, because otherwise the Future has no way of knowing if a message it receives is a completion message or a closure (in the case the future wants to be completed with a closure).</p>
<p>This is a bit tricky because I both want my futures to act as actors and I also want them to be able to hold any type of value…</p>
<p>I did not find a way to do that, so it seems that the API will be a bit different when extracting a future to an actor or another future, this is not optimal but it will have to do.</p>
<p>I also realized that I need to have a special message for extraction / forward. Indeed I need to pass the address to which send the extracted value, but I cannot create a closure with it inside (in retrospect I should have seen this issue earlier), so I will pass that as an argument.</p>
<p>I could just send the ActorRef, but I prefer to also send a closure so that we can type the message, that is send a T instead of a Box&lt;Any + Send&gt; that would need to be casted (and is also not <code>Sync</code>).</p>
<p>Thus we will have an enum for computations that looks like the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span class="kw">enum</span> computation <span class="op">{</span>
    Forward(actorref, closure)
    Complete(actorref, closure)
    computaion(closure)
<span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
