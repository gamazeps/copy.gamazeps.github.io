<h1 id="some-realisations">Some realisations</h1>
<p>Talking with some friends in bioinformatics made me relize that I do not have the stuff to back my “senior” aspirations and that stings a bit.</p>
<p>Some serious grunt work seems to be needed even though it feels pointless.</p>
<p>Mathieu told me a week ago that he expected me to be able to get my senior software engineer in about a year if I put in the work. Out of a spirit of challenge I want to get that done in 6 months (even though his expectation was more than generous on my abilities).</p>
<p>I propose an experience: spend the next 30 days cramming on Haskell and distributed systems to be good at it and see how fast I can progress.</p>
<p>The only issue I have with this experiment is that except for the distributed systems part, I am pretty sure that the skills I could get in that experience are not transferable. For instance I would dream to be one day able to work at DeepMind</p>
