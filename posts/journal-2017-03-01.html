<h1 id="blog-1">Blog 1</h1>
<p>Hi stranger it’s been a while ! (6 monthes)</p>
<p>I had a bit of a chaotic time in the past few months and thus did not take the time to keep writting a work journal, but it is time to get back to work now.</p>
<h1 id="short-term-objectives-and-motivation">Short term objectives and motivation</h1>
<p>For a long time I have acted as if I was extremely into machine learning and deep learning but did not dedicate much time to it, which is quite a poor way of showing my so called interest.</p>
<p>In order to fix that issue I spend the last week watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6Wd9FR--EfW8dtjAuPoTuPcqmOV53Fu">Nando de Freitas classes on Deep learning</a>, bought a <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-0">few</a> <a href="http://www.deeplearningbook.org/">books</a> on the subject and started doing the DL <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/">practicals</a> (finished the 3rd on Monday). I must say that I was a bit surprised by the practicals as they are mostly boilerplate code to fill in, and do not force me to write my model from scratch, but it is quite likely because the teacher assumed no background in coding for the class wanted to focus on DL specific tasks.</p>
<p>Today I managed to watch two videos on Reinforcement learning from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&amp;t=6s">David Silver’s class</a>, which were also very interesting. I found the introduction of dynamic programming (implied by the Bellman equation), to be a fun surprise as I did not expect it to pop up in this area (this might be why it also was mentionned in the Russ Tedrake <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/underactuated-robotics-mitx-6-832x-0">robotics class</a> on edx).</p>
<p>Once I am done with this video series the plan will be to finish the Nando de Freitas practicals and assigments (in order to make sure that I am still in shape maths-wise).</p>
<h1 id="self-improvement">Self improvement</h1>
<h2 id="journal">Journal</h2>
<p>I recently realised that when I stopped focusing on planning my days and weeks I tended to fail my days, which is not optimal to say the least…</p>
<p>This is why I came back to this journal system as it makes me take a look back at my days and find out what are common mistakes that I make and make me waste my time.</p>
<h2 id="systems">Systems</h2>
<p>Quite related to the journal issue is the system one.<br />
I used to have systems ordering my actions around, thus taking a lot of thoughts out of my day and allowing me to focus and do the things that I ought to be doing.</p>
<p>There were recently some good work done on food by planning meals before doing groceries ans thus giving me less opportunity to eat junk food (I still have to fight my morning croissants, but I need to find a replacement for them).</p>
<p>I will thus try to integrate more of my daily time in a system, the first step being writting a journal at the end of each day and publishing it, it may make me look like an idiot but will at least keep me accountable in this area.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>On the bright side I managed to start reading books again, which is a great win over the previous situation.</p>
<p>The current objective is to read at least a book (~350 pages long) every two weeks, with an objective of reading one per week in reality.</p>
<p>Right now my book is <a href="http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/the-grid-9781608196104/">The Grid</a>, which is about the US electric infrastructure and how it came to be what it is today. The problems it exposes about wind and solar power were new to me and very enlightening, hopefully the rest of the book will be as interesting (even though the explication of how electricity, tension and current work were a bit shaky for a technical audience, which is probably not the intended one anyway).</p>
<p>The next book will probably be either Elon Musk bio or a book about <code>chomage</code> (joblessness) in France recommended to me by a rather smart colleague.</p>
<p>I will need to find a way to incorporate reading in my system, the current idea is to finish the day by reading.</p>
<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>
<p>I started getting back to the gym, which is good, but not as often as I would like to, which is less good.</p>
<p>Getting back to interval training was more physically demanding than expected but I was rather happy with what I was able to do (4km of alternating 3 minutes at 14km/h and 1 minute at 6km/h, with 1.5km at 11km/h before and after).</p>
<h1 id="proposed-new-system">Proposed new system</h1>
<ul>
<li>In the morning take my gym bag if I intend to go to the gym.</li>
<li>Stretching during daily scrum</li>
<li>Plan my work and afterwork day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Daily job.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the gym if I took my bag</li>
<li>Do the things planned for the personal day (ticking off the tasks in order)</li>
<li>Write my journal entry</li>
<li>Read for 30 minutes</li>
<li>Sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>I would also like to try writting the things I did well each day, as according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1RVRAdiSH4qxjBgxm_plng">100 days</a>, it is a good way to feel better about yourself, which sounds nice.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long journal entry but it was a while since last time.</p>
