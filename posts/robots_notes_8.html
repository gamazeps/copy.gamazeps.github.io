<h1 id="coding-with-no-anger.">Coding with no Anger.</h1>
<p>Well, now that I know that there are no elegant (or rustic) implementation of what I wanted to do I went with a non elegant one and it works perfectly.</p>
<p>The solution was to have two types of message</p>
<pre><code>pub struct Complete {
    complete: Box&lt;Any + Send&gt;,
}

pub enum Computation {
    Computaton(Func),
    Forward(ActorRef, Func),
}</code></pre>
<p>and to try to downcast the message the Future receives twice.</p>
<p>The first message is put directky in the mailbox of the Actor without using <code>context.tell</code>, thus the <code>context.complete</code> code is a close duplication of the code in the tell method, but itâ€™s really because of an edge case so it seems OK to me.</p>
<h1 id="plan-for-today.">Plan for today.</h1>
<p>Now I wil need to add a good error handling for the Futures, so that we can make actors fail if they try to complete a Future twice (plus having a way to make actors fail seems pretty useful on its own).</p>
<p>I also realized yesterday that I need to add unit tests for basic behaviours, such as receiving a single message or asking something. This behaviour is already tested in bigger tests, but not having tests for these behaviours is pretty bad.</p>
