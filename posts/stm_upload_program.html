<p>In a previous article we saw how to compile a “Hello LED”, but did not actually run this program on a board, thus it was a bit useless.</p>
<p>Let’s now see how we can put a program on a board and what are the tools involved in this operation.</p>
<h1 id="launch-an-openocd-server">Launch an openocd server</h1>
<p>First you will need to launch an openocd server, this allows you to connect yourself to your board.</p>
<p>The command here (on ubuntu at least) is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">openocd</span> -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/board/stm32f4discovery.cfg</code></pre></div>
<p>The -f option allows you to specify the path to the configuration file that will be used to connect to the board.<br />
Such a file provides information about the link type, the frequency of the transmission, the endianness and so on… You will never have to write such a file yourself in this tutorial and will probably never have to write one at all (except if your job is firmware engineer).</p>
<p>You should have an output looking like:</p>

<p>This means that you have not plugged your board in, or that it is not recognized by your computer.</p>
<h1 id="launch-arm-none-eabi-gdb">Launch arm-none-eabi-gdb</h1>
<p>Now that we have an interface to the board we will have to interract with it in some ways, that’s where gdb comes at play !</p>
<p>gdb is the GNU debugger, it allows us to controll the flow of execution of our program, and in this instance to do that on the board, from our own computer.</p>
<p>First launch gdb and provide it a path to the binary that we are going to use (here the Hello LED one).</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">arm-none-eabi-gdb</span> build/ch.elf</code></pre></div>
<p>You should see:</p>

<h2 id="connect-to-the-board">Connect to the board</h2>
<p>Now that we have a running gdb we will need to connect ourselve to the board, that’s why we launched (and kept running) opencd.</p>
<p>In order to connect to it, type the following command in the gdb prompt.</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) target extended-remote localhost:3333</code></pre>
<p>Here we tell gdb that our target is a remote one (not on your machine) and that we can conect to it through port 3333 (which has been open by openocd).</p>
<h2 id="put-the-program-on-the-board">Put the program on the board</h2>
<p>Once this is done you now have control over the board.</p>
<p>First you will want to stop the program currently beeing executed with:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) mon halt</code></pre>
<p>Then you will want to load your program on the board</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) load</code></pre>
<p>And then you can either tell the board to reset itself (with the new program) or you can launch it and surveil it with gdb</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) mon reset</code></pre>
<pre><code>(gdb) continue</code></pre>
<p>If you did that you should see a blue LED blink on your board.<br />
Congratulation you just upload your first program to a board (at least to this one) !</p>
