<p>I have published a ChibiOS/RT tutorial series a while back (like 3 years ago), and I am thinking about updating them and repost them here (as they are no hosted on my website).</p>
<p>This series will introduce you how to use ChibiOS/RTâ€™s driver, as I have to say the documentation is a bit hard to understand. The idea is to use these articles as a cookbook for your embedded projects with ChibiOS/RT.</p>
<p>The platform will most likely be an stm32f407 discovery board, as it is ridiculously cheap and powerful (plus I have a few lying around).</p>
<p>I am also thinking about dabbling with ATTiny in the near future in order to do some silly projects (mostly LEDs that react to interraction, kinda like what we did with some friends with the <a href="https://www.hackster.io/team-paf-machi-rei/spirits-of-the-city-176b6c?offset=0&amp;ref=search&amp;ref_id=kodama">kodamas</a>).</p>
